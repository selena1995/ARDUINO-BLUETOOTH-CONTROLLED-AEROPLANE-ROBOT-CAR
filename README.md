# ARDUINO-BLUETOOTH-CONTROLLED-AEROPLANE-ROBOT-CAR
Here in this instructable, l am going to make a simple Arduino Bluetooth-controlled robot car. Though I have made several Arduino robot cars this time I have made a little few changes to this robot model. I have added two wings which are like an Aeroplane. This is a concept for future cars. Hope this instructable will help you as previously.
